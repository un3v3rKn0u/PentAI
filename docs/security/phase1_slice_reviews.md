# Phase 1 slice security reviews

These records use the `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` sole-maintainer exception. They are formal
project reviews but are not independent security reviews and do not satisfy any
external dual-control requirement.

## 2026-08-08 — Source provenance intake

**Decision:** Sole-maintainer security review — non-independent<br>
**Reviewer:** `un3v3rKn0u`<br>
**Roles held:** author, sole maintainer, Product Owner, Security Lead, repository owner

**Scope reviewed:** Program/source APIs, immutable provenance persistence, migration
`0004_source_provenance.sql`, audit events, compatibility behavior, tests, contracts,
and security documentation in `feature/source-provenance-intake`.

**Evidence examined:** complete diff against `main`; source authority and kind checks;
manifest hash binding; immutable-row triggers; idempotent import behavior; audit-chain
coverage; migration upgrade test; negative tests for blank, malformed, unsupported,
and missing-Program inputs; repository quality checks reported with the slice.

**Findings:** No unresolved material finding. Missing or ambiguous provenance fails
closed. Source content is not returned or written to audit data. Existing rows receive
compatible defaults and are not rewritten.

**Limitations and deferred work:** This slice stores provenance metadata only. It does
not claim encrypted originals, file/URL acquisition, field-level provenance, or any
target-facing enforcement. Cross-platform behavior remains dependent on CI.

**Residual risk accepted:** The review is self-authored and non-independent. The
limited assurance is accepted for this internal slice under the sole-maintainer
exception; it does not approve later Phase 1 execution capabilities.

## 2026-08-08 — Encrypted source storage

**Decision:** Sole-maintainer security review — non-independent<br>
**Reviewer:** `un3v3rKn0u`<br>
**Roles held:** author, sole maintainer, Product Owner, Security Lead, repository owner

**Scope reviewed:** AES-256-GCM content-addressed source store, OS credential-service
key custody, one-use desktop-to-core key delivery, migration
`0005_encrypted_source_blobs.sql`, packaged-core lifecycle changes, dependency locks,
negative/recovery tests, ADR 0002, and related contract/security documentation.

**Evidence examined:** complete diff after synchronization with `main`; AEAD nonce and
associated-data binding; digest verification; atomic write/fsync/rename sequence;
wrong-key, tamper, malformed-object, missing-key, digest-mismatch, and write-failure
tests; legacy migration behavior; desktop key generation/retrieval/error handling;
key output scans; packaged PyInstaller lifecycle smoke; local Python, Rust, UI, and
contract checks.

**Findings:** No unresolved material finding. Missing or ambiguous credential-store
results fail closed. Only a definite missing-entry result creates a new key. Blob
authentication or storage failure prevents provenance persistence. Legacy placeholders
remain explicitly marked unavailable rather than being relabeled as encrypted.

**Limitations and deferred work:** Windows Credential Manager and Linux Secret Service
behavior require hosted verification. Key rotation, key backup/restore, locked-store
manual testing, native file selection, and URL acquisition remain deferred and block
production claims. Python cannot guarantee complete in-memory key zeroization.

**Residual risk accepted:** This is a self-authored, non-independent review. Its reduced
governance assurance and the documented cross-platform/key-lifecycle limitations are
accepted for the internal slice only. It does not authorize target-facing execution.

## 2026-08-08 — Bounded file-source import

**Decision:** Sole-maintainer security review — non-independent<br>
**Reviewer:** `un3v3rKn0u`<br>
**Roles held:** author, sole maintainer, Product Owner, Security Lead, repository owner

**Scope reviewed:** Path-free authenticated file-import API, base64 transport bound,
filename/media/extension/content validation, encrypted persistence integration, audit
linkage, negative tests, and `docs/security/file_source_import_slice.md`.

**Evidence examined:** complete diff after synchronization with the encrypted-storage
mainline; the 2 MiB decoded-content bound and matching encoded transport bound;
rejection of paths, empty/oversized payloads, unapproved or mismatched media types,
binary or malformed UTF-8 text, malformed JSON, invalid PDF signatures, and invalid
base64; encrypted round-trip and audit-content tests; repository quality checks.

**Findings:** No unresolved material finding. The core receives bytes and a basename,
never a caller-controlled filesystem path. Invalid or ambiguous content fails closed
before provenance persistence, and accepted originals use the existing authenticated
encrypted store without exposing content in audit records.

**Limitations and deferred work:** PDF validation is signature-only and conveys no
rendering-safety claim. Files are stored but never rendered or parsed beyond the stated
checks. A native file picker still needs bounded, race-resistant regular-file reads.
URL acquisition, previews, extraction, and active-content rendering remain deferred.

**Residual risk accepted:** This is a self-authored, non-independent review. The
limited assurance and documented format-validation limitations are accepted for this
internal storage-only slice. It does not authorize target-facing execution.
