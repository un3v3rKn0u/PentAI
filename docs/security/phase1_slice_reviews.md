# Phase 1 slice security reviews

These records use the `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` sole-maintainer exception. They are formal
project reviews but are not independent security reviews and do not satisfy any
external dual-control requirement.

## 2026-08-08 — Source provenance intake

**Decision:** Sole-maintainer security review — non-independent<br>
**Reviewer:** `un3v3rKn0u`<br>
**Roles held:** author, sole maintainer, Product Owner, Security Lead, repository owner

**Scope reviewed:** Program/source APIs, immutable provenance persistence, migration
`0004_source_provenance.sql`, audit events, compatibility behavior, tests, contracts,
and security documentation in `feature/source-provenance-intake`.

**Evidence examined:** complete diff against `main`; source authority and kind checks;
manifest hash binding; immutable-row triggers; idempotent import behavior; audit-chain
coverage; migration upgrade test; negative tests for blank, malformed, unsupported,
and missing-Program inputs; repository quality checks reported with the slice.

**Findings:** No unresolved material finding. Missing or ambiguous provenance fails
closed. Source content is not returned or written to audit data. Existing rows receive
compatible defaults and are not rewritten.

**Limitations and deferred work:** This slice stores provenance metadata only. It does
not claim encrypted originals, file/URL acquisition, field-level provenance, or any
target-facing enforcement. Cross-platform behavior remains dependent on CI.

**Residual risk accepted:** The review is self-authored and non-independent. The
limited assurance is accepted for this internal slice under the sole-maintainer
exception; it does not approve later Phase 1 execution capabilities.
