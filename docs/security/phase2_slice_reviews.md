# Phase 2 slice security reviews

## 2026-08-20 — AI provider configuration contract v1

**Review record:** Sole-maintainer security review — non-independent.

**Roles held by reviewer:** repository owner, author, Product Owner, Principal
Architect, Security Lead, Core Maintainer, Contract Maintainer, and Security Reviewer.
The `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` sole-maintainer exception is used. This review is not independent
and does not satisfy any external independence or dual-control requirement.

**Scope reviewed:** The complete provider configuration schema, deterministic validator,
synthetic tests, compatibility documentation, Phase 2 dependency ordering, and the
unchanged Phase 1 authorization/network boundary.

**Invariants and trust boundaries:** `INV-AUTH-003`, `INV-AGENT-001`,
`INV-AGENT-004`, and `INV-DATA-001`; untrusted configuration/model producers to the
trusted core policy; core to a future secret broker; core to future local and remote
provider adapters. No provider, broker, adapter, model, evidence, or network boundary
is crossed by this slice.

**Threat and abuse cases examined:** provider/model substitution, provider-type
confusion, configuration expiry and future dating, remote use without dual opt-in,
raw credential fields, cross-provider secret references, secret or restricted raw
evidence routing, unknown properties, disabled execution mutation, zero/unbounded and
over-ceiling budgets, and configuration data attempting to expand the trusted
allowlist.

**Default-deny findings:** Schema validation precedes semantic validation. Exact
provider/model allowlists are supplied by trusted code. Missing, malformed, stale,
ambiguous, conflicting, unsupported, privacy-violating, or over-budget inputs deny with
stable codes. No configuration value can enable execution or create authorization.

**Compatibility, migration, privacy, secrets, and rollback:** The v1 contract is
additive and has no legacy consumers. No migration or persistence is introduced.
Remote routing is explicit and deny-by-default; secret and restricted raw evidence are
forbidden. Only opaque, provider-bound secret references are representable. Rollback
removes the additive files without data conversion or authority recovery.

**Evidence examined:** Targeted and full Python tests, JSON contract validation, Ruff,
mypy, complete branch diff, staged-path review, and scans for credentials, real targets,
databases, caches, generated output, and merge markers. Exact command results are
recorded in the pull request.

**Findings:** No material finding accepted. The local-runtime cost value is configured
but not reserved or charged; all budget enforcement beyond validation remains deferred.

**Limitations and residual risk:** Provider adapters, real secret storage/resolution,
context assembly, runtime budget accounting, prompt-injection defenses, structured
output, persistence/audit, UI, and provider availability are absent. The slice must not
be described as completing either provider-adapter or full allowlist/budget action-plan
items. Governance assurance is reduced because review is non-independent; the sole
maintainer accepts that governance risk only for this local-development contract slice.

## 2026-08-20 — Trusted AI provider registry v1

**Review record:** Sole-maintainer security review — non-independent.

**Roles held by reviewer:** repository owner, author, Product Owner, Principal
Architect, Security Lead, AI/Agent Lead, Core Maintainer, Contract Maintainer, Data
Protection Lead, and Security Reviewer. The `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` exception is used. This
review is not independent and cannot satisfy an external independence requirement.

**Scope and evidence:** Complete registry schema/compiler, configuration-policy
composition change, synthetic tests, contract documentation, action-plan note, complete
diff, contract validation, Python unit and pytest suites, Ruff, mypy, and repository
scans. Exact results are recorded in the pull request.

**Invariants and boundaries:** `INV-AUTH-003`, `INV-AGENT-001`, `INV-AGENT-004`, and
`INV-DATA-001`; untrusted registry documents to trusted deterministic compilation, and
compiled policy to provider-configuration validation. No provider, secret broker,
evidence store, model, target, or network boundary is crossed.

**Threat and abuse cases:** malformed/missing registry data, provider/model
substitution, duplicate identity ambiguity, order-dependent disabled entries, stale or
future policy, configuration outliving policy, expired-policy reuse, empty/degraded
allowlists, forbidden data routing, invalid budgets, execution-enable mutation, and
source-document mutation after compilation.

**Default deny and findings:** Schema validation precedes semantic compilation.
Malformed, stale, ambiguous, privacy-unsafe, and empty-enabled registries deny with
stable codes. Compiled maps are immutable snapshots with registry revision and expiry.
Configuration cannot outlive or reuse expired registry policy. No material finding is
accepted.

**Compatibility, privacy, secrets, migration, and rollback:** Additive registry v1;
configuration v1 remains compatible. Secret and restricted raw evidence routing denies,
and the registry stores no secret references or values. There is no persistence or
migration. Rollback removes the additive registry boundary without data conversion or
authority recovery.

**Limitations and residual risk:** Registry origin authentication, signatures,
rollback protection, durable activation/revocation, audit, UI, adapters, context
construction, secret brokerage, and runtime budget accounting are deferred. Execution
remains disabled. Non-independent review reduces governance assurance; the sole
maintainer accepts that risk only for this local-development non-executing slice.
